API Documentation
The API endpoint /v1/forecast?current_weather=true accepts a geographical coordinate, a list of weather variables and responds with a JSON hourly weather forecast for 7 days. Time always starts at 0:00 today and contains 168 hours. If &forecast_days=16 is set, up to 16 days of forecast can be returned. All URL parameters are listed below:

Parameter	Format	Required	Default	Description
latitude, longitude	Floating point	Yes		Geographical WGS84 coordinate of the location
elevation	Floating point	No		The elevation used for statistical downscaling. Per default, a 90 meter digital elevation model is used. You can manually set the elevation to correctly match mountain peaks. If &elevation=nan is specified, downscaling will be disabled and the API uses the average grid-cell height.
hourly	String array	No		A list of weather variables which should be returned. Values can be comma separated, or multiple &hourly= parameter in the URL can be used.
daily	String array	No		A list of daily weather variable aggregations which should be returned. Values can be comma separated, or multiple &daily= parameter in the URL can be used. If daily weather variables are specified, parameter timezone is required.
current_weather	Bool	No	false	Include current weather conditions in the JSON output.
temperature_unit	String	No	celsius	If fahrenheit is set, all temperature values are converted to Fahrenheit.
windspeed_unit	String	No	kmh	Other wind speed speed units: ms, mph and kn
precipitation_unit	String	No	mm	Other precipitation amount units: inch
timeformat	String	No	iso8601	If format unixtime is selected, all time values are returned in UNIX epoch time in seconds. Please note that all timestamp are in GMT+0! For daily values with unix timestamps, please apply utc_offset_seconds again to get the correct date.
timezone	String	No	GMT	If timezone is set, all timestamps are returned as local-time and data is returned starting at 00:00 local-time. Any time zone name from the time zone database is supported. If auto is set as a time zone, the coordinates will be automatically resolved to the local time zone.
past_days	Integer (0-2)	No	0	If past_days is set, yesterday or the day before yesterday data are also returned.
forecast_days	Integer (0-16)	No	7	Per default, only 7 days are returned. Up to 16 days of forecast are possible.
start_date
end_date	String (yyyy-mm-dd)	No		The time interval to get weather data. A day must be specified as an ISO8601 date (e.g. 2022-06-30).
models	String array	No	auto	Manually select one or more weather models. Per default, the best suitable weather models will be combined.
cell_selection	String	No	land	Set a preference how grid-cells are selected. The default land finds a suitable grid-cell on land with similar elevation to the requested coordinates using a 90-meter digital elevation model. sea prefers grid-cells on sea. nearest selects the nearest possible grid-cell.
Additional optional URL parameters will be added. For API stability, no required parameters will be added in the future!
