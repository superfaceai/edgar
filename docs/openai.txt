Authentication
The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. Visit your API Keys page to retrieve the API key you'll use in your requests.
Remember that your API key is a secret! Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Production requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service.
All API requests should include your API key in an Authorization HTTP header as follows:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

================================================================================

Requesting organization
For users who belong to multiple organizations, you can pass a header to specify which organization is used for an API request. Usage from these API requests will count against the specified organization's subscription quota.

Example curl command:
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'OpenAI-Organization: org-v4K1R4d2hhbjZEAtqTyrarKT'

Example with the openai Python package:
import os
import openai
openai.organization = "org-v4K1R4d2hhbjZEAtqTyrarKT"
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
openai.Model.list()

Example with the openai Node.js package:
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from "openai";
const configuration = new Configuration({
    organization: "org-v4K1R4d2hhbjZEAtqTyrarKT",
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
const response = await openai.listEngines();

Organization IDs can be found on your Organization settings page.

================================================================================

================================================================================

Create completion
POST
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/completions

Creates a completion for the provided prompt and parameters

Request body
model
string
Required
ID of the model to use. You can use the List models API to see all of your available models, or see our Model overview for descriptions of them.
prompt
string
Optional
Defaults to <|endoftext|>
The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.

Note that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.
suffix
string
Optional
Defaults to null
The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.
max_tokens
integer
Optional
Defaults to 16
The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion.

The token count of your prompt plus max_tokens cannot exceed the model's context length. Most models have a context length of 2048 tokens (except for the newest models, which support 4096).
temperature
number
Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.
top_p
number
Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.
n
integer
Optional
Defaults to 1
How many completions to generate for each prompt.

Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop.
stream
boolean
Optional
Defaults to false
Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message.
logprobs
integer
Optional
Defaults to null
Include the log probabilities on the logprobs most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if logprobs is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the logprob of the sampled token, so there may be up to logprobs+1 elements in the response.

The maximum value for logprobs is 5. If you need more than this, please contact us through our Help center and describe your use case.
echo
boolean
Optional
Defaults to false
Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion
stop
string
Optional
Defaults to null
Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.
presence_penalty
number
Optional
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

See more information about frequency and presence penalties.
frequency_penalty
number
Optional
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

See more information about frequency and presence penalties.
best_of
integer
Optional
Defaults to 1
Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.

When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions and n specifies how many to return – best_of must be greater than n.

Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop.
logit_bias
object
Optional
Defaults to null
Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this tokenizer tool (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

As an example, you can pass {"50256": -100} to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.
user
string
Optional
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

Example request
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use log probability to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.

Creates a job that fine-tunes a specified model from a given dataset.
Response includes details of the enqueued job including job status and the name of the fine-tuned models once complete.
Learn more about Fine-tuning

Request body
training_file
string
Required
The ID of an uploaded file that contains training data.

See upload file for how to upload a file.

Your dataset must be formatted as a JSONL file, where each training example is a JSON object with the keys "prompt" and "completion". Additionally, you must upload your file with the purpose fine-tune.

See the fine-tuning guide for more details.
validation_file
string
Optional
The ID of an uploaded file that contains validation data.

If you provide this file, the data is used to generate validation metrics periodically during fine-tuning. These metrics can be viewed in the fine-tuning results file. Your train and validation data should be mutually exclusive.

Your dataset must be formatted as a JSONL file, where each validation example is a JSON object with the keys "prompt" and "completion". Additionally, you must upload your file with the purpose fine-tune.

See the fine-tuning guide for more details.
model
string
Optional
Defaults to curie
The name of the base model to fine-tune. You can select one of "ada", "babbage", "curie", "davinci", or a fine-tuned model created after 2022-04-21. To learn more about these models, see the Models documentation.
n_epochs
integer
Optional
Defaults to 4
The number of epochs to train the model for. An epoch refers to one full cycle through the training dataset.
batch_size
integer
Optional
Defaults to null
The batch size to use for training. The batch size is the number of training examples used to train a single forward and backward pass.

By default, the batch size will be dynamically configured to be ~0.2% of the number of examples in the training set, capped at 256 - in general, we've found that larger batch sizes tend to work better for larger datasets.
learning_rate_multiplier
number
Optional
Defaults to null
The learning rate multiplier to use for training. The fine-tuning learning rate is the original learning rate used for pretraining multiplied by this value.

By default, the learning rate multiplier is the 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 depending on final batch_size (larger learning rates tend to perform better with larger batch sizes). We recommend experimenting with values in the range 0.02 to 0.2 to see what produces the best results.
prompt_loss_weight
number
Optional
Defaults to 0.01
The weight to use for loss on the prompt tokens. This controls how much the model tries to learn to generate the prompt (as compared to the completion which always has a weight of 1.0), and can add a stabilizing effect to training when completions are short.

If prompts are extremely long (relative to completions), it may make sense to reduce this weight so as to avoid over-prioritizing learning the prompt.
compute_classification_metrics
boolean
Optional
Defaults to false
If set, we calculate classification-specific metrics such as accuracy and F-1 score using the validation set at the end of every epoch. These metrics can be viewed in the results file.

In order to compute classification metrics, you must provide a validation_file. Additionally, you must specify classification_n_classes for multiclass classification or classification_positive_class for binary classification.
classification_n_classes
integer
Optional
Defaults to null
The number of classes in a classification task.

This parameter is required for multiclass classification.
classification_positive_class
string
Optional
Defaults to null
The positive class in binary classification.

This parameter is needed to generate precision, recall, and F1 metrics when doing binary classification.
classification_betas
array
Optional
Defaults to null
If this is provided, we calculate F-beta scores at the specified beta values. The F-beta score is a generalization of F-1 score. This is only used for binary classification.

With a beta of 1 (i.e. the F-1 score), precision and recall are given the same weight. A larger beta score puts more weight on recall and less on precision. A smaller beta score puts more weight on precision and less on recall.
suffix
string
Optional
Defaults to null
A string of up to 40 characters that will be added to your fine-tuned model name.

For example, a suffix of "custom-model-name" would produce a model name like ada:ft-your-org:custom-model-name-2022-02-15-04-21-04.
