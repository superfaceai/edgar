API Reference authentication
This reference helps you implement the RESTful Pipedrive API v1. This API uses a JSON format for output and is capable of handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests. The API is stateless – all requests are validated against an API token. The API token can be obtained manually from the Pipedrive app.


================================================================================

Activities

Activities are appointments/tasks/events on a calendar that can be associated with a deal, a lead, a person and an organization. Activities can be of different type (such as call, meeting, lunch or a custom type - see ActivityTypes object) and can be assigned to a particular user. Note that activities can also be created without a specific date/time.

ActivityTypes

Activity types represent different kinds of activities that can be stored. Each activity type is presented to the user with an icon and a name. Additionally, a color can be defined (not implemented in the Pipedrive app as of today). Activity types are linked to activities via ActivityType.key_string = Activity.type. The key_string will be generated by the API based on the given name of the activity type upon creation, and cannot be changed. Activity types should be presented to the user in an ordered manner, using the ActivityType.order_nr value.
Get all activity types
GET/v1/activityTypes
Returns all activity types.

Currencies
Supported currencies which can be used to represent the monetary value of a deal, or a value of any monetary type custom field. The Currency.code field must be used to point to a currency. Currency.code is the ISO-4217 format currency code for non-custom currencies. You can differentiate custom and non-custom currencies using the is_custom_flag property. For custom currencies, it is intended that the formatted sums are displayed in the UI using the following format: [sum][non-breaking space character][currency.symbol], for example: 500 users. Custom currencies cannot be added or removed via the API yet — rather the admin users of the account must configure them from the Pipedrive app.
Get all supported currencies
GET/v1/currencies
Returns all supported currencies in given account which should be used when saving monetary values with other objects. The code parameter of the returning objects is the currency code according to ISO 4217 for all non-custom currencies.

Deals

Deals represent ongoing, lost or won sales to an organization or to a person. Each deal has a monetary value and must be placed in a stage. Deals can be owned by a user, and followed by one or many users. Each deal consists of standard data fields but can also contain a number of custom fields. The custom fields can be recognized by long hashes as keys. These hashes can be mapped against DealField.key. The corresponding label for each such custom field can be obtained from DealField.name.

Add a new filter
POST/v1/filters
Adds a new filter, returns the ID upon success. Note that in the conditions JSON object only one first-level condition group is supported, and it must be glued with 'AND', and only two second level condition groups are supported of which one must be glued with 'AND' and the second with 'OR'. Other combinations do not work (yet) but the syntax supports introducing them in future. For more information, see the tutorial for adding a filter.
Body parameters
application/json

name
STRING
REQUIRED
The name of the filter
conditions
OBJECT
REQUIRED
The conditions of the filter as a JSON object. Please note that a maximum of 16 conditions is allowed per filter and date values must be supplied in the YYYY-MM-DD format. It requires a minimum structure as follows: {"glue":"and","conditions":[{"glue":"and","conditions": [CONDITION_OBJECTS]},{"glue":"or","conditions":[CONDITION_OBJECTS]}]}. Replace CONDITION_OBJECTS with JSON objects of the following structure: {"object":"","field_id":"", "operator":"","value":"", "extra_value":""} or leave the array empty. Depending on the object type you should use another API endpoint to get field_id. There are five types of objects you can choose from: "person", "deal", "organization", "product", "activity" and you can use these types of operators depending on what type of a field you have: "IS NOT NULL", "IS NULL", "<=", ">=", "<", ">", "!=", "=", "LIKE '$%'", "LIKE '%$%'", "NOT LIKE '$%'". To get a better understanding of how filters work try creating them directly from the Pipedrive application.
